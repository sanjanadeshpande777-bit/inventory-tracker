1) What it does
   This project is a simple browser-based Inventory Tracker that allows users 
   to add, view, edit, and delete parts or items. It includes a basic login 
   system and saves all data using LocalStorage so that entries persist even 
   after refreshing the page.
2) How to run it
   Download or clone the project files and open index.html in any web browser.
   Log in using the default credentials (e.g., username: sanjana, password: 12345) 
   to access the inventory dashboard.
3) What works so far
   The login system functions correctly, new parts can be added with validation,
   all items are displayed in a table, and both editing and deleting of entries 
   work smoothly. Data remains saved across sessions.
4) What I'd do next if I had more time
   Adding support for Role-Based Access Control to manage different user privileges.
